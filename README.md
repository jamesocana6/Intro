I'm a software engineer that is passionate about making games and apps to solve some of my daily problems. Coding is my creative outlet and I want to keep learning until I can turn an idea into a fully functioning app. I like to manipulate and organize data to gain a better understanding of trends and ideas. 

Languages and libraries/frameworks I've worked with:
| Languages | Libraries/Frameworks |
| --- | ---- |
| Java | |
| Javascript | jQuery, express, ejs, React |
| CSS | bootstrap, skeleton, normalize, materialize |
| HTML | |

I'm currently working on a math game to practice mental math and pattern recognition! This is a project I used to learn how to code in Java. After I complete my software engineering bootcamp, I plan to revisit this game and implement what I learned to spice up the code and style of the game a litte more!
